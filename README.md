# 🚗 License Plate Reader Project

This project detects and reads vehicle license plates from images or a live camera feed using a trained machine learning model. It uses OpenCV for image processing, PyTorch for ML inference, and Kivy for the GUI. Detected plate numbers are logged into CSV files with timestamps.

---

## 🔧 Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Linux or WSL (for Windows users)
- Virtual environment (recommended)
- System dependencies:
  - OpenCV
  - PyTorch
  - Kivy

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies

- Use **Linux or WSL** on Windows
- Make sure **Python 3.8+** is installed

### 2. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/virendradk/license_reader_project.git
cd license_reader_project
```

### 3. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # For Linux or WSL
```

### 4. Install Python Packages

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. Run the Application

```bash
python main.py
```

---

## 🧠 Model Info

- Make sure your trained PyTorch model file (e.g., `license_plate_model.pt`) is loaded inside `detector.py`.
- The model should support image input and return the license plate string.
- You may place your `.pt` model in a new folder like `models/` if needed.

---

## 📦 `requirements.txt`

```txt
kivy==2.3.0
opencv-python
torch
torchvision
numpy
Pillow
```

---

## ✅ Features

- Detect license plates from:
  - 📷 Live camera feed
  - 🖼️ Image selection (via FileChooser)
- Capture on button click
- Logs detected plates to multiple CSV files
- Kivy-based GUI
- Logs crashes or runtime issues
- Buildozer ready for APK packaging

---

## 📄 CSV Logging

The app creates or updates these files:

- `detection_log.csv`
- `plate_log.csv`
- `log.csv`

Each file includes entries like:

```
Timestamp, License Plate Number, Source
```

You can modify `file_logger.py` to customize log behavior.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting & Tips

### ✅ Setup Checklist

| Checkpoint                             | Status / Action Needed                                  |
|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| ✅ Code is committed to GitHub          | Ensure latest code is pushed.                            |
| ✅ `requirements.txt` is complete       | Provided in the repo.                                    |
| ⚠️ ML model path configured             | Ensure detector.py loads your model correctly.           |
| ✅ `main.py` launches GUI               | Confirmed working with `python main.py`.                 |
| ✅ Virtualenv activated                 | Always run inside `venv`.                                |
| ✅ Camera permissions enabled           | Required for live detection.                             |

### ⚠️ Common Issues

- **Camera not working?** Try running on a native Linux install or check camera permissions in WSL.
- **File not found?** Ensure all required files (images, logs, models) are in place.
- **Crash on launch?** Review `crash_log.txt` and `log.txt` for debugging.
- **OCR not detecting?** Make sure model accuracy is verified or add preprocessing.
